# Hackathon Demo Script - 5 Minute Pitch

## Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [name] and this is **Align** - an AI productivity agent that adapts to YOUR capacity, not arbitrary deadlines. Most productivity apps treat you like a robot. We know you're human."

## 1. Dashboard - First Impression (30 seconds)
- Show capacity score prominently displayed
- Point out the trend chart: "This shows my productivity patterns over time"
- Highlight current mode badge: "Right now I'm in [mode] mode"
- "This isn't just another todo list - we track YOUR actual capacity"

## 2. Daily Check-in - The Foundation (45 seconds)
- Click "Daily Check-in" in sidebar
- Slide through energy, sleep, stress: "Takes 30 seconds"
- Select mood with visual icons
- Submit: "Watch the AI calculate my capacity score"
- "This data feeds our AI to make intelligent decisions"

## 3. Today's Plan - The AI Magic (90 seconds)
- Click "Today's Plan" (point out AI badge)
- Click "Generate AI Plan"
- While generating: "The AI is analyzing my capacity, pulling tasks from Todoist, and creating a REALISTIC schedule"
- Show generated plan: "See? Not 20 tasks - just what I can actually complete today"
- Expand AI reasoning: "Full transparency - you see WHY the AI made these decisions"
- Point out priority badges, time estimates, scheduled times
- "One click syncs this to Google Calendar"

## 4. Integrations - Ecosystem Play (30 seconds)
- Click "Integrations"
- Show Todoist connected: "Tasks automatically flow in"
- Show Google Calendar: "Plans sync out"
- Show Gemini AI: "Transparent about our AI stack"
- "We enhance your existing tools, not replace them"

## 5. Analytics - Getting Smarter (30 seconds)
- Click "Analytics"
- Show 30-day trend: "Pattern detection learns my rhythms"
- Point out insights: "AI tells me I'm most productive on [day]"
- "The system gets smarter over time"

## 6. Goals - Purpose-Driven (20 seconds)
- Click "Goals"
- Show existing goals with categories
- "Goals give the AI context - it prioritizes tasks that matter"

## 7. Settings - Polish & Control (20 seconds)
- Click "Settings"
- Toggle dark mode: "Working dark mode"
- Toggle notifications: "User control over preferences"
- "Privacy transparency builds trust"

## Closing (30 seconds)
"Align solves the fundamental problem with productivity apps: they ignore your actual capacity. We use AI to adapt to how you're REALLY feeling, create realistic plans, and learn your patterns over time. It's not just a todo app - it's an AI agent that understands you're human."

## Key Stats to Mention
- Built with Next.js 15, Google Gemini AI, PostgreSQL
- Real OAuth integrations with Todoist and Google Calendar
- Encrypted token storage for security
- Pattern detection ML for analytics
- Production-ready, not a prototype

## Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How is the capacity score calculated?**
A: "We use a weighted algorithm considering energy, sleep quality, stress level, and mood. Higher energy and sleep boost capacity, while stress reduces it. The AI then selects an optimal mode."

**Q: What if I don't use Todoist?**
A: "You can create goals directly in Align, and the AI will generate tasks based on those goals. Todoist integration is optional but powerful."

**Q: How does the AI decide which tasks to schedule?**
A: "It considers three factors: your capacity score, task priority, and time estimates. In Recovery mode, it schedules fewer, easier tasks. In Deep Work mode, it brings on the challenges."

**Q: What makes this different from other AI productivity apps?**
A: "Three things: 1) We start with YOUR capacity, not tasks. 2) We show AI reasoning - full transparency. 3) We integrate with existing tools instead of forcing you to switch."

## Demo Tips
- Have a pre-populated account with check-in history
- Have Todoist connected with sample tasks
- Have 2-3 goals already created
- Practice the flow multiple times
- Keep energy high and enthusiastic
- Emphasize "AI" and "adaptive" throughout
- Show, don't just tell - click through the app

## Backup Slides (if allowed)
1. Architecture diagram showing AI flow
2. Capacity calculation formula
3. User testimonial or use case
4. Roadmap for future features
