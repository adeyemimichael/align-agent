1. **Complete Product**: Not a prototype - a fully functional app with all expected features
2. **AI Throughout**: Every section either uses AI or feeds data to AI
3. **Beautiful Design**: Professional UI that looks like a real product
4. **Real Integrations**: Works with Todoist, Google Calendar - not isolated
5. **Human-Centered**: Acknowledges that humans aren't robots - capacity varies
6. **Data-Driven**: Analytics and patterns show we're serious about productivity science
7. **Transparent**: Shows AI reasoning, explains data usage
8. **Polished**: Working toggles, smooth animations, consistent design language

### Demo Flow for Judges:

1. **Start at Dashboard** - "This is Align, an AI productivity agent that adapts to YOUR capacity"
2. **Show Check-in** - "Unlike other apps, we start by understanding how you're feeling today"
3. **Generate Plan** - "Watch the AI create a realistic schedule based on your capacity"
4. **Show AI Reasoning** - "See? It's not a black box - you understand the decisions"
5. **Show Integrations** - "We work with tools you already use - Todoist, Google Calendar"
6. **Show Analytics** - "Over time, we learn your patterns and get smarter"
7. **Show Goals** - "And it's all aligned with your long-term goals, not just busy work"

### Key Differentiators:

- **Adaptive AI**: Plans change based on YOUR capacity, not generic rules
- **Human-Centered**: Acknowledges you're not a robot
- **Transparent**: Shows AI reasoning
- **Integrated**: Works with existing tools
- **Beautiful**: Professional design that impresses
- **Complete**: Every feature works, nothing is "coming soon" (except notifications)

### Winning Pitch:

"Most productivity apps treat you like a robot - they assume you have the same capacity every day. Align is different. We use AI to adapt to YOUR actual capacity. Start your day with a 30-second check-in. Our AI analyzes your energy, sleep, stress, and mood to calculate your capacity score. Then it generates a realistic daily plan - not an overwhelming list, but a schedule you can actually complete. We integrate with Todoist and Google Calendar, so you don't abandon your existing workflow. And we learn over time - our analytics detect your patterns and the AI gets smarter. This isn't just another todo app. It's an AI agent that understands you're human."
